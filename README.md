KL Interpreter and Compiler
=======================================

This is a simple compiler and interpreter for a simple language called KL.

In a nutshell, KL supports integer variables, if-then-else statements and while-loops. See the grammar file for a detailed definition.

Parameters can be passed to a KL programm. They are directly assigned to the variables "a" (first parameter), "b" (second parameter), ...

The result, which will be returned, has to be saved in the variable with the name "x".
